Tenzies-Game

Tenzies Game is a game where you roll a die and pick a number you would determine to hold at every roll i.e before you roll, youve decided number 6 is the number you want. After number has been decided you roll the die, tap on the number decided (6) to hold that spot and hold on the number everytime a 6 shows up.
